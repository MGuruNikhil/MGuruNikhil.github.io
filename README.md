# Portfolio site (Astro + Tailwind)

This repo is an initial scaffold for your portfolio website using Astro and Tailwind CSS.

Next steps:
- Add your profile content (name, bio, projects, resume) into the `src/pages` files or create MDX content.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` and run `npm run dev` to preview locally.
- Update the contact form action to your Formspree form id or another backend.

GitHub Pages notes:
- The workflow creates a `dist/.nojekyll` file before publishing to avoid GitHub Pages trying to build the site with Jekyll (which can error on `.astro` files).
- If you prefer to publish from a `docs/` folder on `main`, tell me and I'll update the workflow.
