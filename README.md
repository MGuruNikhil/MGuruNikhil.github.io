# Portfolio site (Astro + Tailwind)

This repo is an initial scaffold for your portfolio website using Astro and Tailwind CSS.

Next steps:
- Add your profile content (name, bio, projects, resume) into the `src/pages` files or create MDX content.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` and run `npm run dev` to preview locally.
- Update the contact form action to your Formspree form id or another backend.
